# "Oddam w dobre ręce" *(eng. "I will give it to good hands")*
> One of the graduates of the UX course - prepared a prototype of the project. The aim of this is to create a place where everyone will be able to give away unnecessary things to trusted institutions - many studies and observations have been carried out on the basis of which the model of the project was created. Based on this and ready-made HTML templates, I created the backend of the application.
